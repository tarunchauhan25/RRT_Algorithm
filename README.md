# RRT_Algorithm

For this project I have used the following python libraries: matplotlib.pyplot, matplotlib.patches, shapely.geometry, geopandas, numpy, random and math.
The aim of this project was to implement RRT_Algorithm used for path planning.

Some bugs in the code:
1. The graph does not get updated in a single output screen, we have to close the current graph to see the next updated graph.
2. The code continues to run even after finding the goal.
3. The color of obstacles, start point, end point and path are same.
4. Does not show the final path from start to end.
